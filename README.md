# helloDevops
orientation exercise

TLDR;

1. Make sure that you have a github account
2. Click on "Use this template" in the top right corner
3. Pick "Open in a codespace" from the submenu
4. Change hello.py to be about you
5. run by typing `python hello.py` in the terminal window

You don't need to hand this in or anything. I hope that it was fun.
